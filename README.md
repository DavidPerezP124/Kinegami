# Kinegami
Given a D-H representation of a kinematic chain robot, the program generates a crease pattern that folds into a kinematically equivalent robot.

# User Guide:
Run scripts contained within kinegami-tests and change parameters if desired. For more comprehensive understanding, reference files contained in main, sphere-bounding-support-files, DXF-library, and fold-types, all of which contain supporting functions.
