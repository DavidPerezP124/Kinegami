# Kinegami
Given a D-H representation of a kinematic chain robot, the program generates a crease pattern that folds into a kinematically equivalent robot with compliant joints. The program takes in the D-H representation and assigns the corresponding joint to a location that is sufficiently far from other joints while keeping the same kinematic properties. Then an origami link inspired by the Dubin's path method is created to connect every two conseccutive joints. 

To construct the D-H representation, follow the variable definitaion ("Link length (a)", "Link twist (alpha)", "Joint offset (d)", and "Joint angle (theta)") and numbering system of this kinematic chain mechanism schematic drawing to form a table:

The folded state of the origami module, its spacial operator representation, and its crease pattern is shown here: (A) the origami prism tube, (B) the flange, (C) the elbow fitting, (D) the twist fitting, (E) the revolute joint, and (F) the prismatic joint.

# User Guide:
Run scripts Kinegami_******.m for existing examples and change parameters if desired. 
To create your kinematic chain robot, fill out the Kinegami_Template.m file in this order:
1. design the regular polygon shape (the number of sides "nside" and circumradius "r") as the tubular origami base
2. determine the number of joints for your robot, fill in the number of joints plus one (the fingertip) in variable "n".
3. fill in the DH parameters specifications for variable "D" following the joint design.
4. specify joints information, all variables that contain "??", including TYPE, maximum joint range, initial joint configurations, etc.
5. In addition, modify the user specifications for crease pattern generation including DXF printing and segmentations.

For more comprehensive understanding, reference supporting functions. The algorithm requires "fSolve" from the MatLab Optimization Toolbox. Please install the add-on Optimization Toolbox.

# Laser cutting instructions:
The crease pattern generated by the algorithm can be output as a .dxf file, its unit is meters.
The blue lines indicates the mountain folds, the red indicates the valley folds, and the black lines indicates the boarder edges.
We then cut our specimen with the "PLS 4.75" laser cutting machine.
For the blue and red line, we perforated the paper by setting the machine parameters to be (power 10, speed 20, ppi 25).
For the black line, we cut the paper by setting the machine parameters to be (power 10, speed 20, ppi 750).
The paper we use is the 8 mil thick Durilla synthetics paper with polyester finish (CTI Paper, USA).

# Updates:
7/5/2021:
Edited JointAssignment.m to include correct value of rs for Prismatic Joints.
Edited Kinegami.m to support plotting for Proximal and Distal Frames. Added new function frameplot.m for frame plotting. Changed manner in which figures are closed in papercut files.
