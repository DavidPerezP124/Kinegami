# Kinegami
Given a D-H representation of a kinematic chain robot, the program generates a crease pattern that folds into a kinematically equivalent robot.

# User Guide:
Run scripts SphericalKinegami.m, UniversalKinegami.m, PlanarKinegami.m, or CylindricalKinegami.m and change parameters if desired. For more comprehensive understanding, reference supporting functions.
