# Kinegami
Given a D-H representation of a kinematic chain robot, the program generates a crease pattern that folds into a kinematically equivalent robot.

# User Guide:
Run scripts contained within kinegami-tests and change parameters if desired. Reference files contained in main, sphere-bounding-support-files, DXF-library, and fold-types, which all contain supporting functions.
